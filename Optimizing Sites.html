1. Copy and paste the site url into gtmetrix.com and developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights.
2. Check and compare scores.
  -Gtmetrix has useful tools like waterfall and speed stats.
  -Pagespeed score is more accurate and is considered more important for SEO.
3. Enable gzip and caching.
  -Open htaccess file in content section of ftp.
  -Paste in this code. Should cover almost all categories of files.

4. Optimize images
  -Crop images to reasonable size ( If applicable ) 
  -Run images through Tinypng.com
  -Then recheck the site in pagespeed/insights and download the new optimized assets.
    *NOTE* Sometimes pagespeed/insights will resize the images for you, but in my experience I've found it to be very bad at it. If pagespeed/insights does that to your images, I would resize the images yourself, or just ignore it.
  -If needed, check to make sure that images are scaling properly on the website as well, and fix that with css/inline html attributes if necessary.
5. Remove Render Blocking Javascript
  -Open File that references javascript files near the top of the page ( Usually functions.php or header.php )
  -Add async to script tags as appropriate/move scripts to the footer. E.G. <script src="path/to/your/file.js"></script> becomes <script href="path/to/your/file.js" async="async"></script>
6. Optimizing CSS Delivery hasn't been figured out yet.
7. Upload Minified versions of normalize.css, webflow.css and webflow.js files.
  -Will be in your optimized assets zip file that Pagespeed/insights provides.
  -Only upload minified files that won't be touched. EG webflow.css but not your-site.css or style.css.
